- Voice Input: Voice input: Allows students to ask questions using voice input for convenience.
- Dynamic Graphs: Dynamic graphs: Visualizes math and data structures concepts with dynamic graphs. Graphs change when relevant data changes.
- Code Execution: Code execution: Executes code snippets for programming questions to demonstrate the outputs.
- Algorithm Simulation: Algorithm simulation pages: Provides algorithm simulation pages for array, graph, and tree data structures, visualized automatically based on selected user configurations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#9D2EC5), for intelligence, expertise, and focus, contrasting with the dark background.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-purple (#23192C). Dark mode enhances readability for coding and mathematical content.
- Accent color: Vibrant pink (#D90368), placed 30 degrees 'left' of the primary color, draws attention to key interactive elements and enhances user engagement.
- Body: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for its clean, modern, readable qualities that make it suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, clear icons to represent different subjects and functionalities.
- Clean and structured layout to make content easily accessible and digestible.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide the user through the learning process.
